## About the Simulation
This software simulates the behavior of slime mold using the Godot Engine, optimized with multiple Compute Shaders to enhance performance.

It allows real-time adjustments to key parameters, such as boid movement, sensor settings, and trailmap configurations during the simulation. The focus is on visually showcasing slime mold behavior, letting users see how changing parameters affects its patterns and movement.

## Running the Program

### Executable File
The latest build for Windows can be downloaded directly from the [Releases](https://github.com/Toaschty/SlimeMoldPlayground/releases) page.

### Building the Project
The project can be compiled from the source code using Godot Engine 4.3. While other versions of Godot may work, compatibility issues could occur. To build for Windows, macOS, or Linux, follow the standard Godot export process for each platform.
